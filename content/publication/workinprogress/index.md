abstract: "We study the impact of World War II on women's labor market outcomes in Italy, in the short and long run, using a novel dataset that combines information on war fatalities with employment records from the Italian Social Security Institute and Census data. To conduct the analysis, we exploit the exogenous variation at the provincial level of male military fatalities. First, we estimate through a difference-in-differences analysis the short and long-run effects of male soldiers' mortality during the war on women's labor force participation. Then, we check whether WWII had long-lasting effects on wages and the number of worked weeks in the period covered by our sample of administrative data, 1980-1997. Our findings suggest that WWII had both an immediate and persisting impact on female labor force participation and a long-run positive effect on worked weeks. The impact of the war on women's wages remains instead unclear."
