abstract: "Existing research on the cost of job loss has typically overlooked the role of job sorting after displacement in the perpetuation of recursive unemployment. This study aims to fill this gap by estimating the decline in job security associated with the occupations matched by displaced employees following their dismissals. Using a dataset containing the employment histories of about four million individuals working in Italy that allows for disentangling voluntary from involuntary job moves, I construct two indicators of job security attached to each specific occupation: one that captures the risk of dismissal and the other that conveys a measure of expected tenure. Then, employing an identification strategy that exploits mass layoffs as exogenous variations, I estimate the impact of job loss on the expected job security of subsequent jobs. I find that displacement episodes generate an increased risk of dismissal intrinsic to the following job match of about 2.38% and a lower expected tenure of around 156 days."
