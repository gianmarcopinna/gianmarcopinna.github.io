abstract: "This work investigates the effect of a policy measure implemented by the Italian government in 2014 called “Nuova Sabatini.” This measure was aimed at easing access to credit for small and medium businesses, supporting investments in the acquisition of technological equipment. We exploit a difference-in-differences design to estimate the causal impact of the measure on different firm outcomes, namely capital stock, value-added, mean salary, and employment. Overall, we estimate that the measure significantly increased both firms’ workforce and capital stock. Furthermore, we find very heterogeneous effects on employment by sector, size of the firm, and region of location. We then extend the analysis to include firms that select into treatment multiple times, finding evidence that granting access to credit multiple times enhances the effectiveness of the measure compared to firms applying just once."
