## Welcome!

As of September 2025, I will join the National Bank of Slovakia as a Senior Economist. I hold a Ph.D. in Economics and Finance from the Tor Vergata University of Rome. 

My research interests include topics in labor economics and applied microeconomics. 

I also hold a B.Sc. in Economics from the University of Cagliari and a M.Sc. in Economics from the University of Bologna. I have also worked in between my Master's and Ph.D. studies as a trainee and a research analyst in the DG-Economics of the European Central Bank and as a trainee in the Economics Department of the European Investment Bank.
