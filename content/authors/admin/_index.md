## Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Economics and Finance Department of the Tor Vergata University of Rome. My research interests include topics in labor economics, policy evaluation, economics of the European Union, and economic history. My job market paper investigates the mechanisms behind the origins of recursive unemployment, with a particular focus on the role of job security.

I hold a B.Sc. in Economics from the University of Cagliari and a M.Sc. in Economics from the University of Bologna. I have also worked in between my Master's and Ph.D. studies as a trainee and a research analyst in the DG-Economics of the European Central Bank and as a trainee in the Economics Department of the European Investment Bank.
