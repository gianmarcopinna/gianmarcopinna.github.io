## Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Economics and Finance Department of the Tor Vergata University of Rome. My research includes topics in labor economics, policy evaluation, and economic history.

I hold a B.Sc. in Economics from the University of Cagliari and a M.Sc. in Economics from the University of Bologna. I have also worked for the European Central Bank and the European Investment Bank in between my Master's and Ph.D. studies.
