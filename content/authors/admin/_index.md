## Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Economics and Finance Department of the Tor Vergata University of Rome. My research interests include topics in labor economics and applied microeconomics.

This fall, I will be on the job market!

In my job market paper, I investigate the mechanisms behind the origins of recursive unemployment, with a closer look at the possible role of job security and the search and matching process that occurs following dismissal.
I hold a B.Sc. in Economics from the University of Cagliari and a M.Sc. in Economics from the University of Bologna. I have also worked in between my Master's and Ph.D. studies as a trainee and a research analyst in the DG-Economics of the European Central Bank and as a trainee in the Economics Department of the European Investment Bank.
